    Rocket lab is doing great, not even a month after the last launch, here is another one in a few hours, called "return to sender". The launch of rockets into space is exciting, but this one is to be followed with particular attention, for the following reasons:

    1- there is a 3D printed titanium gnome on board;
    2- Gabe Newell billionaire from valve software, will be donating one dollar to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Starship childrenâ€™s hospital for every person who
    watches the launch online at www.rocketlabusa.com/live-stream and www.twitch.tv/RocketLabUSA (source: rocketlab);
    3- The recovery of the first stage of the electron rocket will be attempted, something already done by SpaceX, but the first time ever for RocketLab;
    4- 30 satellites will be put into orbit about 500 km from the Earth's surface on behalf of various small satellite operators.
    
    Space travel is becoming more and more interesting lately, and this is no exception.

<h2>FOLLOWING THE PAYLOADS:</h2>
    <h3>PAYLOAD: DRAGRACER</h3>
  <p>
    The DRAGRACER mission will test the effectiveness of new tether technologies designed to accelerate spacecraft reentry and reduce orbital
debris at the conclusion of space missions. TriSept has completed the integration of a pair of qualified Millennium Space Systems 6U small
satellites, one featuring the tether drag device and one without. The controlled spacecraft should deorbit in approximately 45 days, while the
second spacecraft is expected to remain in orbit for seven to nine years, according to Tethers Unlimited, developer of the 70-meter-long (230
feet) Terminator Tape aboard the control satellite. Source:RocketLab
  </p>
<h3>PAYLOAD: BRO-2 and BRO-3</h3>
  <p>
    BRO-2 and BRO-3 are the second and third satellites in French company Unseenlabsâ€™ planned constellation of about 20 satellites dedicated to
    maritime surveillance. The first BRO satellite was launched to orbit by Rocket Lab in August 2019. Unseenlabsâ€™ constellation enables improved
    monitoring of activities at sea, such as illegal fishing and anti-environmental behavior. Thanks to a unique proprietary technology, the BRO
    satellites are the first to be able to independently and precisely locate and fingerprint Radio Frequency (RF) emitters all around the globe, day or
    night, in any weather condition, and without requiring any special embarked tracking device. With three satellites in orbit, Unseenlabsâ€™ clients
    can now benefit from the shortest revisit time available on the satellite RF geolocation market. Source:RocketLab
  </p>
  <h3>PAYLOAD: SPACEBEES</h3>
<p>
    Swarm will launch the latest 24 1/4U SpaceBEE satellites to continue building out its planned constellation of 150 satellites to provide affordable
satellite communications services to IoT devices in remote regions around the world. Swarmâ€™s uniquely small satellites enable the company to
provide network services and user hardware at the industryâ€™s lowest cost and deliver maximum value to customers across a range of industries
including maritime shipping, agriculture, energy, and ground transportation. The SpaceBEES will be integrated into two of Rocket Labâ€™s 12U
Maxwell CubeSat dispensers for orbital deployment. Source:RocketLab
</p>

<h3>PAYLOAD: APSS-1</h3>
<p>
    The student-built Waka Ä€miorangi Aotearoa APSS-1 satellite is
designed to monitor electrical activity in Earthâ€™s upper atmosphere to
test whether ionospheric disturbances can predict earthquakes. The
data from this mission will deliver deeper knowledge of these hardto-
access altitudes and drive understanding of how phenomena such
as solar wind and geophysical events affect this atmospheric. Source:RocketLab
