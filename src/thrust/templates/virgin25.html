        <p>On May 25th, 2023, Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc., the pioneering aerospace and space travel company, is set
            to open the flight window for its anticipated Unity 25 spaceflight​​. This mission will mark a significant
            milestone in the journey towards commercial space tourism, making space more accessible to private
            individuals and researchers.
            The Unity 25 mission will be the first spaceflight for Virgin Galactic since the historic Unity 22 mission
            in 2021, where company founder Richard Branson himself flew to space​​. The Unity 25 mission is set to
            take off from Spaceport America in New Mexico, using Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo spaceplane, VSS
            Unity​​.

            The crew for this mission will consist of six Virgin Galactic employees, including two pilots who have
            previous experience flying the SpaceShipTwo to space, and four passengers, one of whom has previous
            spaceflight experience​​. This crew will conduct the final assessment of the full spaceflight and astronaut
            experience before the company's commercial service begins in late June​​.

        <p>The VSS Unity will be carried to an altitude of roughly 50,000 feet by the WhiteKnightTwo mothership, VMS
            Eve, in a parasite configuration before being released. After release, the VSS Unity will ignite its rocket
            engine, propelling it to over 50 miles (80 km) in altitude, above the U.S. definition for the start of space
            but below the internationally recognized Kármán line at 62 miles (100 km)​​.

            Once at this altitude, passengers will experience a few minutes of zero gravity and spectacular views of
            Earth before the spaceplane reenters the atmosphere and lands on the same runway it took off from​.
            The Unity 25 mission is seen as a precursor to Virgin Galactic's commercial space tourism operations, with
            the first commercial flight planned for late June 2023, should Unity 25 prove successful​​.

            Despite facing setbacks, including a fatal accident in 2014, Virgin Galactic is gearing up to kick start its
            commercial operation, fulfilling a long order list with hundreds of customers who had already paid $450,000
            each for the service. The initiation of commercial service is also expected to aid the production of the
            company's next-generation Delta Delta class spaceships​​.

            The Unity 25 mission is more than just a spaceflight; it's a stepping stone towards a future where space
            travel is within reach for more people, opening up a universe of possibilities. Virgin Galactic's mission,
            to offer customers a transformative experience, connects the world to the awe and wonder created by space
            travel​. The Unity 25 launch is one to watch, as it marks the advent of a new era in space exploration and
            tourism.
