    <p>Imagine if we all suddenly need to leave the starship we call Earth. Do we have a lifeboat? an emergency escape
      device? Well in this article we will discover what humanity so far
      had reached in order to answer those questions, and unfortunately is not that much.
    </p>

    <p>In order to do the classification, we are going to consider spaceships that are able at the present moment to go
      beyond the imaginary Karman line (100 km above earth surface) with the crew inside and can stay in orbit. That
      said among all spaceships available around the planet only 3 satisfy the abovementioned criteria, for a combined
      total crew capacity of 13 people. We are not in a good shape, especially considering that the first man went to
      space almost 60 years ago and we are (2020) almost 8 billion living souls on this planet.
    </p>

    <p>Things are not improving when considering the countries which are able to launch humans into space giving the
      astonishing number of 3 only: Russia; China and the United States of course. Now, let`s explore some info about
      these spaceships.</p>
    <p> The most successful spacecraft of all the time with the most crewed launches is the "Soyuz" with
      144 launches since 1967, follows China with 6 launches of their "Shenzou" spacecraft active since 2003 and finally
      the new kid on the block the private company owned by Elon Musk, SpaceX with the Crew Dragon with 2 successful
      crewed launches since May 2020. The NASA American Space shuttle is dismissed but during the period of activity,
      reached the crewed 135 orbital flight. </p>

    <h3>Here Below listed the main technical specification of these three spacecraft:</h3>

    <h1>Future Plans</h1>
    <h3>Fortunately things are about to change.</h3>

    <p>
      The Future is exciting and the new space race is started, we are seeing an escalation of investment, interest, and
      resource towards the space industry. It is a new space race but substantially different from the one during the
      cold war, that was more political and to show that moon landing and space travel was actually achievable than
      anything else, and eventually
      ended. Now, from the United to States China the plan is to create a self-sustained colony on the space, moon,
      Mars, and beyond. Imagine that as an expansion of our earth, people today fly from Rome to Los Angeles or anywhere
      else on the planet in a 10km high harsh environment and what they worry about is if they already have seen that
      movie on the on-board entertainment, well this was inconceivable only 150 years ago.
      Huge multi-billion worth companies are moving fast to change the status quo to name only a few
      Blue Origin SpaceX and Boeing .
    </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    We are not at the present moment able to sustain a multi planetary or deep space crewed mission with our actual
    spaceships. As can be seen, even if the human can leave the earth, will last only a few weeks on a free flight.
