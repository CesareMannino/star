  <p>Relativity Space is one of the most promising private American company which will compete with 
    the big ones already there as SpaceX. They are profoundly different from any other company in the 
    business since their rockets will be entirely 3d printed. The founders Tim Ellis and Jordan Noone, 
    are not new on the business since they were both working for the Jeff Bezos`s Blue Origin. (Noone went
    on to work for SpaceX as well). 
    It`s important to highlight that Relativity Space are not only building rockets but are engineering 
    creating unique state of the art 3d printing machine.

    <p>Furthermore the fact that the rockets are totally 3d printed has the following benefit:

      1- Reduction up to 100 times less  parts compared to traditional rockets;
      2- Fast manufacturing process as low as under than 60 days to go from raw material to have the rocket
      on the launchpad;
      
      The big recent achievement was the relocation of the company to the new headquarter in Long Beach, 
      California. The key factor of this relocation is the capability, thanks to the increased space, 
      and the third generation of 3D-printers, to build a single part of metal up to 11 meters tall.
      
      The new 11150 square meters factory as per the vice president of factory development
      "Zach Dunn" words, it will allow to fully produce the "Terran 1 rocket" 
      
      A very important feature of this new headquarter in Dunn`s words it will be the closeness of the engineering offices from the actual engineering area. Similar on what`s happening with Elon Musk`s 
      "SpaceX". This will give the engineers the possibility to quickly check the progress of what being printed. 
      
      As per his own <a href='https://youtu.be/nVuVIm-LThc?t=330' target="_blank">words</a> "Tim Ellis"  , the other rockets companies are still using a decades old and slow approach for the rocket building process. 
      The Relativity space approach is based on design and develop a product which is closely monitored by
      software algorithm which trough continuous analysis gives feedback to engineer in order to improve the 
      rocket whole building process structure and performance. 
      It means that the rocket being built is consistently improved version of itself. And this is game changing compared to the old approach of building the same rocket over and over based on the original project. 
      
    </p>
  <p>the Terran 1 engine is Aeon 1, in house made engine which has been recently tested(November 2020) in a full 187 seconds mission simulation at the Nasa`s Stennis Space Center in Missisipi.  

    The road map is advancing fast and the Company look to perform their first launch as soon as next year.
    A not very well known similarity with the most famous SpaceX is the plan to go to mars. The CEO Tim Ellis as documented on this  <a href='https://youtu.be/npSVWfQzNdQ?t=76' target="_blank">Ted Talk</a>  given almost eight years ago,
    made it clear that humanity should be multiplanetary with Mars as first colony. This vision is still present to
    him and transferred to his "Relativity Space" company, making in fact the only other company than SpaceX which want to reach Mars. </p>
